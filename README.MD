# Instructions
Use the react framework to complete the following exercise. 
- You should not use any other ui or component libraries to complete the task. 
- Your application should access the required data from the endpoint found below.
- Your application should load the data dynamically. (the data should get reloaded every time the page is refreshed)

- All work will be completed in the client directory where a starter for create-react-app has been generated. 

- The data can be retrieved by accessing the `localhost:3001/companies` endpoint. Axios is listed as a dependency within the react project and can be used to make the request for data. Instructions for setup and starting the node server express application can be found in the server directory.  You will not need to alter anything in the server directory.

- Create a table with the following columns: name, city, state, phone number, and products.
- Make the table sortable by name in alphabetical order.
- Add filters for state and products.
- A user should be able to perform a text search for name, city, or product.
- Function is the overall focus for this challenge but add in enough CSS to make the table presentable.
- Please fill in any questions you have for the team at the bottom of this README.MD file.  When we meet to review the challenge we can go over each question.
- If you get stuck during project setup please reach out to the individual who issued the challenge and we will do our best to provide assistance.

Bonus (not required):
  - Paginate the results showing 10 results per page.
  - Enable the user to combine search and filters.

To make it easier to provide all files both the client and server are provided in this repository but each is a standalone project.
Pay close attention to which directory you are in when running commands for setup and project start.
