# Server setup instructions
This directory contains a simple node express application with a single endpoint `localhost:3001/companies`

## Steps to setup the server
 

Install project dependencies
- run `npm install` from server directory

Starting the server
- run `npm start`
  - You should see `App listening on port 3001` and you're ready to go.

If you would like to verify the endpoint is working or view the reponse data outside of using axios in the react application postman is an excellent tool for doing so.
